    Prompt the user for all the important stats youâ€™d want on a dating site profile,
    and display them back to the user.

    Prompt the user for:

        First name
        Last name
        Age
        Annual income
        Number of dogs
        Team Jacob or Team Edward

    You can assume that the user enters valid information.
    You should treat each input variable as the appropriate data type.

    #Get inputs from user and store as variables (income is a float)

    income = float(input("What is your annual income?\n"))
    dogs = input("How many dogs do you have?\n")
    team = input("Which man in Twilight do you prefer: Edward or Jacob?\n")

    #Print thank you message and all of the values for the user
    print("\nThank you for your profile information! Here's what we stored for you.\n",
